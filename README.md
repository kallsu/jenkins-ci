# jenkins-ci

This project was built by the need to customize the behaviour of base Jenkins Docker Image ( http://hub.docker.com/jenkins ).

To make more flexible as possible the base Jenkins image, the following tools are added:
- docker, to load and execute own custom builds with one or multiple docker images
- ssh, to manage remotly the server


Thanks
